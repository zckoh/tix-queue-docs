| Source code for application lost               | The developer's machine broke, <br>and the source code is only store on that machine                                                     | Medium     | Very High | Developer       | Ensure backups are stored elsewhere can easily be recovered                   | Mitigate <br>L - Use a version control system like GitHub to store our code                               |
| Unauthorized access to source code             | Malicious attacker that have access to the source code can <br>find vulnerabilities in our application and try to break our application. | Low        | Very High | Developer       | Ensure our code base is only accessible to the application team               | Mitigate<br>L - Make the code repository private and only allow access to application developer           |
| Unauthorized access to database                | Delete all records / steal personal data                                                                                                 | Low        | Very High | AWS / Developer | Try to recover as much data as possible. Identify/fix vulnerability           | Mitigate<br>L - Ensure strong password used for database connection. Backup in RDS                        |
| Database storage full                          | User unable to create new tickets                                                                                                        | Low        | High      | Developer       | Try to increase the storage capacity of the database                          | Mitigate<br>L - When initially setting up the database, provide a decent amount of storage                |
| Server down unable to serve application        | Users unable to access the webapp.                                                                                                       | Very Low   | High      | AWS             | Identify / check which resource is affected and try to restore service        | Accept<br>Accept the risk that AWS could be potentially down but it is very unlikely                      |
| Human error in deployment steps for production | Error in deployment cause deployment to fail/unsuccessful                                                                                | Medium     | High      | Developer       | Identify / review steps taken and correct the mistake made during deployment. | Mitigate<br>L - Use CI pipeline to automate deployment step, preventing any human error during deployment |
